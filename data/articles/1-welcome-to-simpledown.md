# Welcome to SimpleDown!
# Date: September 12, 2011

Thanks for giving us a test. We really appreciate your interest. Here's an example Blog Post to get you familar with SimpleDown, and act as an example to how your blog posts should be formatted.

As you can see, every blog post is just simply Markdown. After the top two lines of the Markdown file (if you haven't found it yet, look under `data/articles/`), just write.

The first two lines, however, are the most important. The first lines tell SimpleDown the title of the blog post, as well as the displayed publish date.

So if you import your old blog posts, you can preserve the dates, as we don't rely on the last modified date to determine the publish date, you set it manually.

We sincerely hope you like the simplicity that SimpleDown provides, and we hope that you help out with some code, if you can. [Our Github page](https://github.com/alexblackie/SimpleDown) is just begging for your contributions.
