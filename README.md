# SimpleDown: ReadMe

SimpleDown is a flat-file, markdown-based blog engine build in PHP. SimpleDown's goal is to be a very simple solution to putting Markdown documents in a blog format.

SimpleDown is far from finished; there are still many things that need to change for it to be production-ready. Those issues can be found in [the Wiki](https://github.com/alexblackie/SimpleDown/wiki/TODO).

The point of making SimpleDown open-source was to allow collaborators to work on, and improve the half-ass workarounds I've used to get the basic system running. Anyone who would be willing to help, please do so. I would love an extra hand helping with this, perferably someone smarter than I.
