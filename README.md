# SimpleDown: ReadMe

SimpleDown is a flat-file, markdown-based blog engine build in PHP. SimpleDown's goal is to be a very simple solution to putting Markdown documents in a blog format.

SimpleDown is far from finished; there are still many things that need to change for it to be production-ready. Those issues can be found in the Wiki.
