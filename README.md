# SimpleDown: ReadMe

SimpleDown is a flat-file, markdown-based blog engine build in PHP. SimpleDown's goal is to be a very simple solution to putting Markdown documents in a blog format.

**SimpleDown is far from finished**; there are still many things that need to change for it to be production-ready. Those issues can be found in [the Wiki](https://github.com/alexblackie/SimpleDown/wiki/TODO).

## Features
*  **Simple** - SimpleDown is powered entirely from a directory of Markdown files. Simply upload your post and you're done.
*  **Fast** - Because we don't rely on a database, SimpleDown is much faster than a database-heavy application.
*  **Markdown!** - The whole purpose of SimpleDown is easy Markdown publishing. No more dealing with TinyMCE or admin interfaces; just write.

## Collaborators
The point of making SimpleDown open-source was to allow collaborators to work on, and improve the half-ass workarounds I've used to get the basic system running. Anyone who would be willing to help, please do so. I would love an extra hand helping with this, preferably someone smarter than I.
