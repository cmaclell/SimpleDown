          <p>I redesign way too much. Because of this, I tend to delete or move stuff. <strong>If you're reading this, it's probably my fault.</strong></p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>The URL moved.</strong> Those pesky URLs are always running away.</li>
            <li><strong>The URL never existed.</strong> It was all just a dream&hellip;</li>
            <li><strong>The URL was deleted.</strong> Maybe I threw it out during spring cleaning&hellip;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No matter what the reason, if you could <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> and tell me where you were trying to go, and I'll try to help as best as I can.</p>
